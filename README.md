# Clappy Bird - Simple C++ Flappy Bird Clone
This project is the first game I have built myself without the aid of a tutorial in C++. It is a simple Flappy Bird clone, with ability to restart and a score tracker.

All assets except the Clap Emoji courtesy of John Horton as part of the LinkedIn Learning C++ Game Programming 1 course.
